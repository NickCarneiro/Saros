[FEATURE, UI] Increase the duration of a balloon notification from 5s to 15s.
[FEATURE, UI] New AddBuddyWizard
[FEATURE, UI] New wizards and context menu
[FEATURE] New colors (suitable for color blind people)
[FEATURE] Skype entry in context menu is only active if the corresponding 
	buddy has entered a Skype username

[FIX] #2958669, receiving a project archive by IBB when being invited to 
	a project now gives actual progress feedback of the running transfer. 
	Also the IBB warning in the add project wizards warns the user about 
	slowness including a bandwidth info (for non tiny projects)
[FIX] #3110220: New registration window gives info on timeout for Jabber 
	account registration
[FIX] #3187098: We now interpret XMPP code 409 correctly.
[FIX] It is now impossible to add 0 projects or buddies to the session
[FIX] The shared project decorator is no longer delayed 
[FIX] #3212089 (In the Create-Account-Waizard you could modify the 
	explaination text below the server entry field.)
[FIX] #3192349 User away image in session window was contrary to reality.
[FIX] Pressing HOME in the JID input field in the AddBuddyWizard makes 
	the cursor jump to the beginning of the text and then immediately

11.2.25
=======
[FEATURE] Disable broken partial sharing temporarily until its issues can be resolved.
[FEATURE] Multiple Project Support. Now we have full multiple project support. 
	Any user with write access to the session can add projects to the session. 
	Also a session can be started with more than one project.
[FEATURE] This implements the suggestion from #2707089 to show only viewport 
	annotations for a user on their active editor. The result is the viewport 
	annotations	appear/disappear as a driver activates/deactivates an editor, 
	enabling their peer to be more aware of where they are.
	
[FIX] Google Talk support Users with a Google account (*@gmail.com, 
	*@googlemail.com) can log in using Saros.
[FIX] #3168457. RosterView now displays Saros support immediately after connection.



11.1.28
=======
[REFACTOR, UI] New Wording - Shared Project Session, Host, Driver, Observer, 
	Roster, Jabber, Contact
[FIX] #3124951. When attempting to delete a roster entry, we test if that 
	person is currently in session and throw an error message if so.
[FIX] Theoretical negative integer overflow risk.
[FIX] Send activity immediately after it was added to the outgoing queue, 
	not only at fixed points in time. The minimum interval between sending 
	activities remains the same.
[FIX] Use different kinds of SVN revisions for detecting and replicating changes.


11.1.7
======
[FEATURE] Removed "Share with VCS support..." action, added a 
	setting "Disable VCS support" in the Prefs, default is false. This setting 
	can also be set in the incoming invitation dialog. If the local user has 
	VCS support disabled, VCS operations are completely ignored by Saros 
	(local or remote), whether she's the host or not. If e.g. just one of 
	three participants in a session has problems with the repository, the 
	others could still use it with no real disadvantage.
[FEATURE] Duration between sending of edits is now configurable via 
	the advanced prefs. It has also been reduced to 300ms, which should 
	greatly improve perceived latency.
[FEATURE] Saros now displays an warning when the user tries to 
	delete a shared project. 

[FIX] Use the actual revision (last changed revision) of resources, 
	instead of the latest revision. 
[FIX] #3115698. Only send to observers if there are any.
[FIX] The discovery manager is called when inviting to check if 
	the user supports Saros. If we're not connected, we just quit that check 
	before going to the discovery service. 
[FIX] #3121271: it was possible to rename/delete contacts when 
	disconnected (this failed of course). Now, those options are only enabled 
	when the roster is connected. 
[FIX] Only need the additional \t (or @) when calling 
	Action#setText(). This fixes these weird box characters that were 
	displayed in the account list. 
[FIX] EncodingManipulator error "Could not set encoding on project", 
	PreferenceManager bug.
[FIX] #3133023 Disable "Remove all driver roles" when no driver 
	exists.
[FIX] #3098992 - Inconsistency when concurrently writing at same 
	position. This patch fixes the broken operational transformation. A bunch 
	of received activities was not executed consecutively anymore in the SWT 
	thread and local actions could be executed in between - milliseconds after 
	the transformation but before the execution of the transformation. 


10.11.26
========
[FEATURE/FIX] Fallback mechanism for VCS activities.

[FIX] Bug #3110837; refactored into one account creation wizard; 
	by patrick and christian
[FIX] 3090390: SharedProject + role changes.
[FIX] Updating/switching individual resources didn't work during the invitation.
[FIX] Use the actual revision (last changed revision) of resources, instead of 
	the latest revision.
[FIX] 2894573: Inconsistencies because of unsaved files during the invitation.
[FIX] If more than one person is in the session, it should not be closed when an 
	invitation is begun, because we are adding to an existing session not 
	abandoning our attempt to set one up.
[FIX] BUG 3096658, 
	http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&aid=3096658&group_id=167540&atid=843359

	https://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=3102956&group_id=167540&atid=843359
	I have climbed a first step to deliver message to follow the launching of the 
	debugger from host on peer site. What now to do is to create Proxy Virtual 
	Machine and proxy Request Objects on peer side.
[FIX] #3101594: SessionView explanation stays visible; 
	https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=167540&atid=843359

           inviter is compatible with the version of the invitee.

[REGRESSION] Copy, paste, undo, redo, etc. are possible for the
observer in Java and C++ files! Such changes are not send to the
other project participants and thus will cause inconsistencies.

[FIX] StopManager doesn't unblock SharedResourcesManager (caused
    problems concerning file activities)
[FEATURE] StopManager is cancellable and doesn't use timeouts any more
[API] StopManager can stop more than one user concurrently
[FEATURE] Statistic: Added a class that collects local text edit
    activities and compares them in relation to concurrency with
    remote text events.
[FEATURE] Adding a contact is now run in a cancelable background task
[FIX] #2795240 New Contact Page doesn't have a progress dialog
[FIX] Eclipse window sometimes didn't respond when creating a new
    account because the operation was running in the SWT thread as well
[FIX] #2808894 New Contact Action fails on Jabber.org
[FIX] #2706878: Add Buddy fails silently in server federation

9.6.23
======

[FEATURE] Synchronize Role Change
[FEATURE] Partial project sharing dialog: Offers the possibility to 
select only part of the project to be shared with the client (experimental)
[FEATURE] Statistic collection which was introduced in the last version now
actually is enabled (if chosen by the user) for the following data:
  * Role changes of the local user and the times s/he stayed in each role
  * Number of users in each session, and how long they were present in 
the same session
  * General platform infos, feedback settings and session data (session 
time and ID)
  * File Transfer statistics such as bandwidth during invitation
[FEATURE] Improved follow mode heuristic on driver change for exclusive 
driver case

[FIX] #2808862: Joining a Session can cause wrong driver information
[FIX] #2808904: Wrong use of HTTPClient
[FIX] #2808839: Outgoing Invitation tries to send directories as files
[FIX] #1609227: Can invite peers that don't use Saros. Saros now checks 
during an invitation whether the remote user supports Saros and shows this 
information to the user in the invitation dialog.
[FIX] #2707197: Renaming contacts needs to be done twice to work
[FIX] #2801628: FileList.match() doesn't work properly
[FIX] Make sure that an archive is used when IBB is the out-bound data 
transfer method
[FIX] Prevent that consistency recovery triggers resource changes
[FIX] More robust handling of a NPE in the invitation dialog observed 
during testing on 2009-06-18
[FIX] A NPE when the project selection dialog was canceled when joining 
a session
[FIX] Race Condition in Consistency Watchdog: Checksum arriving in between
recovery operations could cause the CW-dialog to hang.
[FIX] Support for file transfer using IBB of file size 0 (files of 
length 0 are not supported by OpenFire (raising 405))
[FIX] Sending via archive never switches to last state in invitation 
progress
[FIX] ConnectionSessionManager currently uses wrong state transitions,
which caused a assertion error in the RosterTracker. This fix, makes the
RosterTracker more robust until the CSM is fixed.

[WORKAROUND] #2807689: Editors are opened externally erroneously:
Workaround surpresses files which would have been opened externally
[WORKAROUND] Prevent Saros from reconnecting infinitely if the 
connection to the XMPP server is down

[API] Introduce ProgressMonitoring API in many places to allow 
cancellation and progress.

[INTERNAL] Saros is now aware internally that one Jabber-ID might have 
several presences online


9.5.29
======
[FIX] Cannot create files for consistency recovery under MacOS/Linux
[FIX] Yes button of FeedbackDialog doesn't have the initial keyboard focus
[FIX] Roster view is maximized when Eclipse's welcome screen appears

synchronisation: Needs to be enabled in the advanced preferences.
[FIX] FileUtil.writeFile makes sure parent directories do exist before
writing.
[FIX] Do not try to open editors of files which do not exist (catches
ugly Window error message)
[FIX] #2794436: Logs created in user home: Now they are created in the
directory which contains the Eclipse log (usually .metadata in the
workspace)
[FIX] Can't follow when debugging: Changing the active editor when
debugging was not correctly captured by our IPartListener2.
[FIX] Remove Viewport Annotations at end of session: Annotations were
removed based on an empty editorPool (which was cleared one line before)
[FIX] The Auto-Next feature did not check for disabled button to press
[FIX] #2794319: NullPointerException trying to share a project
[FIX] #2767873: Saros views not visible after plugin installation
[FIX] #2596378: Autoclose of invitation dialog
[FIX] Auto-Next on second page was broken by "[FIX] Handle a race
condition if auto-next is enabled in JoinSessionWizard, but the user
clicks faster than 1s."
[FIX] #2789375: SharedProjectFileDecorations not updated / removed
[FIX] #2789102: InvitationDialog cannot be closed initially

[FEEDBACK] Activated our first survey targetting fast user feedback.

[FEATURE] Improved GUI of the ConfigurationWizard, added links to the
Saros project website in all feedback GUI elements, added contact
information to the feedback preference page, added more information
about the statistic submission (link to Wiki-Website)
[FEATURE] Added a feedback system that asks the user to participate in
an online survey. The interval in which the feedback reminder is shown
is customizable or can be disabled completely in the Preferences

is installed or updated and some user preferences are missing.
[FEATURE] Manually connecting from the Roster View is now always
possible. If configuration details for Jabber are missing a wizard is
shown to enter them right away.
[FEATURE] added StatisticManager which can gather information about the
session. Currently only data about the number of sessions is gathered
and not transmitted at all.
[FEATURE] Added a check button in the invitation dialog that lets the
user specify whether he wants the dialog to close automatically if all
invitations are completed or not.
[FEATURE] Performance: Optimize Operations when transforming to TextEdits
[FEATURE] Added Action to follow a selected person in the SessionView
(FollowThisPersonAction)
[FEATURE] Enable TLS for logging into server (but don't require it,
because we need UI)
[FEATURE] New JIDFileAppender creates log files with the JID of user
currently connected
